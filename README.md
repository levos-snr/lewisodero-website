## ðŸš¨ About this repo (please read!)

The design of this website is inspired by various sources, but I assure you that every piece of code was written from scratch. Unlike other projects, this portfolio was built using unique technologies `like HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, and `jQuery`. While it may look similar to some designs, the code, functionality, and overall structure are completely original and reflect significant personal effort and innovation.
